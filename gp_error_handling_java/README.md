# Practical task repository for General Principles

## General Task Guidelines

* Please make corrections per the principles/topics discussed so far in this course.
* It is recommended that you complete the practical tasks for a topic before proceeding to the next topics.
* A task/subtopic will be considered as complete after all the review comments are incorporated from the below mentioned review process.
* While making changes, any files contained inside package named as 'thirdpartyjars' should be ignored. These file are meant to provide context to the task and are not part of the task.
* **Unit tests** - Some tasks have unit tests implemented, if they exist, they are comprehensive and we are free to change production code in any way until tests are green.
* **Modifying unit tests** - You can modify tests as long as there is **no change in the behavior (e.g. test assertions)** of the tests. You may add more tests if you feel appropriate but this is not expected.
* **Please don't commit**  the following types of data:

  - **build folders** (e.g., "target", "build/", "dist/",  "bin")

  - **build tools folders** (e.g., "node_modules/", "venv/", , "packages", "lib", )

  - **metadata folder and files** (e.g., ".gitignore", ".DS_Store", "*.lock", "/metadata")

  Including these unnecessary files can significantly increase the size of your repository and interfere with the review process, resulting in technical issues and inability to correctly evaluate your solution.
