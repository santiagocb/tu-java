```

## General Task Guidelines

* Please, **don't** change the **Maven or any package versions** of projects.
* Please, make corrections per the principles/topics discussed so far in this course.
* The programming language to be used is **Java**. It is not mandatory to use the latest features of the availalbe JDK version.
* **thirdpartyjars folder** - while making changes, any files contained inside the "thirdpartyjars" folder must not be changed. **Do not modify 'thirdpartyjars' components.** These files are meant to provide context to the task and are not part of it.
* **Unit tests** - they are comprehensive and mentees are free to change production code in any way until tests are green.
* **Modifying unit tests** - mentess are allowed to modify unit tests only to make them compatible with their new, refactored API. Input and output (context and behavior / Arrange and Assert) of tests must be kept. Mentees should not refactor unit tests in the scope of the course.
* **Logic and behavior of the code must be preserved.**
* **Please don't commit**  the following types of data: 

	- **build folders** (e.g., "target", "build/", "dist/",  "bin")

	- **build tools folders** (e.g., "node_modules/", "venv/", , "packages", "lib", )

	- **metadata folder and files** (e.g., ".gitignore", ".DS_Store", "*.lock", "/metadata")

  Including these unnecessary files can significantly increase the size of your repository and interfere with the review process, resulting in technical issues and inability to correctly evaluate your solution.
